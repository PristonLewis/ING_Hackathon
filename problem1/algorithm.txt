Our approach to solve this problem.

Considering there are 10 floors in a building and each room has 10 rooms (100 rooms in entire building)
First we identify the starting(i.e x0,y0) and end position(i.e x1, y1) of the building.
Based on the instructions we recieve from each move (U,R,UR,DR, UL,DL),  we calculate the next move of the batman 
by moving in that direction by one step.
Since there is a restriction in place that with in the given number of steps he needs to reach the loaction.
We need to optimise the solution,
We considered binary search approach to solve this problem.
exactly dividing the building space in to half, then ignoring the either part based on the information we recieve on each move,
we continue this process till he reaches the destination.
Thus reducing the complexity to O(logN)
